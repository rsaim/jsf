                "Many people including children and elderly, have been left without a roof over their head following the slum demolition drive in Faridabad & Okhla, Delhi. Jeevan Stambh Foundation provided relief to the displaced slum dwellers by distributing food packets, water & mosquito nets and also connected them to organisations that could provide them with legal help and also rehabilitate them."
