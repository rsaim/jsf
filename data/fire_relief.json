                "In a massive fire near Daulatpur, Shahbad dairy in Delhi on the 16th of July, more than 80 slum dwellings were gutted. Residents lost their homes and belongings overnight. We provided immediate relief items with the help and support of donors, government officials that helped distribute the relief kits and partner NGOs like Sahyog. We also arranged for study material, school uniforms and stationary items for the children who had lost all their belongings.",
                "This was made possible through the efforts of our volunteers and on-ground teams of Janman and Basti Suraksha Manch. We were able to raise funds with the help of partner groups and individual donors.
