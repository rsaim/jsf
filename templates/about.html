                <p>
                    In 2020, 4 like-minded citizens got together to send one bus that carried migrants wishing to go back to their hometowns amidst a rising pandemic crisis. After fulfilling one bus request, they managed to send more and their team grew one-by-one. As of June 2020, the team sent back almost 1,700 workers by train and organised the travel of more than 2,500 workers by bus. Started with  Chandrajeet Kumar Gupta, Sonam Chaturvedi, Mohd Arman Khan, Upamanyu Raju and Shaurya Roy, the team had both frontend and backend volunteers that were working, verifying, calling and arranging all kinds of aid for those in need. All of this took place in the 1st wave of COVID-19. By the 2nd wave the team grew stronger and shifted their focus to medical aid. From a COVID Care centre to a support centre, JSF completed requests for emergent medical aid around the clock. What started as a non- registered organisation, is now a registered one with a team that is dedicated towards the domains of healthcare, education, livelihood and environment.
